Helpers
=======

This is a collection of helper classes for Android.

Features:

* Helpers to "parse" `Boolean` / `Int` / `Long` / `String` / `Date` / `Double` / `BigDecimal` types. This is great for reading from a `Map`, or for example parsing a `Date` field from a `JSONObject`'s property.
* Helpers for handling bitmaps (i.e. EXIF orientation)
* Helpers for Executor objects
* Helpers for loading custom fonts from the assets folder
* Helpers for working with `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`
* Helpers for working with locations
* Helpers for working with Parcels. Mainly encoding/decoding more safely, preserving `null` status of properties.
* Helpers for working with Views (i.e. cause a re-layout *now* instead of in the next ui thread loop)
* `ActivityResultHelper` for simplifying starting activities with result codes (No more spaghetti code in MainActivity...)
* `RuntimePermissionHelper` for simplifying permission requests on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)
* `FragmentTransitionHelper` for acquiring default transition animation for `Fragment`s
* `SpannableStringBuilderEx` with more help adding spannables
* `CustomTypefaceSpannable` for having a SpannableString with real custom TypeFaces
* `SchedulerHandler` - a `Handler` with scheduling methods
* Controls that support custom typefaces for (`ButtonEx`, `EditTextEx`, `TextViewEx`)
* A `SwipeRefreshLayout` subclass that makes `setRefreshing(...)` more safe, deferring until after `onMeasure` is called.
* Animations for *resizing* a `View` or a `PopupView`, instead of relative scaling
* More stuff! Just explore tha package...

Have fun and a good luck with your projects!
